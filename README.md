# Cascade

Cascade is an open source project for designing, deploying, and administering virtual contact centers and internal communications using OpenStack infrastructure. The project addresses both Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) and Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) models.
The initial goal is to provide the development of omnichannel contact centers and unified communications for small to medium organizations using open source.

Cascade will address the need to cost effectively host virtual contact centers. Features will include Chat, APIs, Messaging, Auditing, Monitoring, Data Analytics etc. 
The only limits are available and provisioned hardware.
Customer engagement is a high priority for delivering quality customer experiences by using cascade. Data metrics will be provided as logged and analyzed data  for ensuring auditing and reporting.
