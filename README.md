# Cascade

Cascade is an open source project for designing, deploying, and administering virtual contact centers and internal communications using OpenStack infrastructure. The project addresses both Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) and Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) models.
The initial goal is to provide the development of omnichannel contact centers and unified communications for small to medium organizations using open source.

Cascade will address the need to cost effectively host virtual contact centers. Features will include Chat, APIs, Messaging, Auditing, Monitoring, Data Analytics etc. 
The only limits are available and provisioned hardware.
Customer engagement is a high priority for delivering quality customer experiences by using cascade. Data metrics will be provided as logged and analyzed data  for ensuring auditing and reporting.

The project aligns with the OpenStack Mission: The project must have a clear and defined scope. It should either:

The project further the OpenStack mission by providing a cloud service, Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS);

and furthers the OpenStack mission by providing a service for operators of OpenStack clouds;

provide deployment and lifecycle management tooling for OpenStack;

provide packaging recipes to be used when deploying OpenStack;

provide client-side tools to enable users to interact with OpenStack (ie OpenStackCLI; or

provide integration to enable adjacent systems to interoperate with OpenStack.

The project follows the OpenStack way (“the 4 opens”):

Open Source:

The proposed project uses an open source license (preferably the Apache v2.0 license, since it is necessary if the project wants to be used in an OpenStack trademark program)

The project must have no library dependencies which effectively restrict how the project may be distributed or deployed

Open Community:

The leadership is chosen by the contributors to the project

If the project has meetings, regular or otherwise, they should be public and in IRC. They should all be logged and published. Project teams have discretion as to where meetings are held. They can be in the project specific IRC channel, if it exists or one of the general meeting channels available. The advantage of hosting meetings in the project specific channel is that project participants not present can catch-up more easily. Whereas holding the meeting in a general channel gives extra visibility and makes it easier to ping other contributors.

The project shall provide a level and open collaboration playing field for all contributors. The project shall not benefit a single vendor, or a single vendors product offerings; nor advantage contributors from a single vendor organization due to access to source code, hardware, resources or other proprietary technology available only to those contributors.

Open Development:

The project uses public code reviews on the OpenStack infrastructure

The project has core reviewers and adopts a test-driven gate in the OpenStack infrastructure for changes

The project provides liaisons that serve as contacts for the work of cross-project teams in OpenStack

Where it makes sense, the project cooperates with existing projects rather than gratuitously competing or reinventing the wheel

Where appropriate, the project adopts technology and patterns used by existing OpenStack projects

Open Design:

The project direction is discussed at the Design Summit and/or on public forums

The project uses the openstack-dev ML to discuss issues

The project ensures basic interoperability with the rest of OpenStack: User-facing API services should support Keystone for discovery and authentication.

The project has an active team of one or more contributors.

The project participates in any goals specified by the TC, as defined by OpenStack-wide Goals. Any existing goals that are not met should be prioritized and completed within the first year of a team joining.

The project meets any policies that the TC requires all projects to meet. For instance, the Project Testing Interface.
