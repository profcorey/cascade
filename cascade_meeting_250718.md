(1:01:20 PM) profcorey: One of the primary issues is to create the project under the namespace x

(1:02:00 PM) profcorey: I will take care of this issue #5 by next meeting on August 1st

(1:02:40 PM) profcorey: I'll have a service stack diagram with the services that are under consideration for the proof of concept deployment

(1:02:59 PM) profcorey: Issue #4 Create a service stack diagram

(1:04:05 PM) profcorey: After creating the project under the x namespace, I will investigate creating our own IRC, etherpad, and storyboard for continuing development

(1:04:46 PM) profcorey: Issue #3 is still a WiP with no new status

(1:05:07 PM) profcorey: And Issue #1 will be completed when Issue #5 is completed

(1:06:38 PM) profcorey: I've added more potential services to the README at https://github.com/profcorey/cascade#

(1:07:38 PM) profcorey: One service that would differentiate Cascade from the other CCaaS's would be the integration of a social networking application such as Mastadon

(1:08:07 PM) profcorey: So this will be aggressively reseasrched

(1:08:26 PM) profcorey: Next meeting as I mentioned will be August 1st

(1:08:44 PM) profcorey: Thanks for attending!
