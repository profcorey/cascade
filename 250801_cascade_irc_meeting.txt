(01:00:59 PM) profcorey: Ok starting another short meeting for the new project, Cascade
(01:01:53 PM) profcorey: Earlier today I pushed changes to add cascade as a New Project
(01:02:26 PM) andrewbonney left the room (quit: ).
(01:02:43 PM) profcorey: It's using x/cascade as its namespace since the project is not yet an official openstack project
(01:04:49 PM) profcorey: I did receive a build failed so I will fix this hopefully today
(01:08:14 PM) profcorey: I will chase down the cause of the build fail and have a status update next meeting, thanks!

(01:33:29 PM) azlan: Hi sir 
(01:33:48 PM) azlan: i am really sorry as i was just too much busy in my code that it went out of my mind 
(01:34:11 PM) azlan: sir i have prepared some documents regarding the previous task you asked me to do 
(01:35:24 PM) profcorey: OK no problem!
(01:36:01 PM) profcorey: Help me, what were the previous tasks again?
(01:36:01 PM) azlan: so sir can you assign me any tasks because i really feel that i am sitting idle and you are working alone 
(01:36:14 PM) azlan: it will help me a lot 
(01:36:38 PM) profcorey: So, I pushed the initial patchset to create the repo for cascade, but ran into 3 issues.
(01:37:04 PM) profcorey: I can fix these as soon as were finished with these and then we should have a repo to start working together
(01:37:13 PM) azlan: yes sir can we discuss those 
(01:38:05 PM) azlan: yes sir sure so will those be covered in this week and our next meeting will be on project working 
(01:38:06 PM) profcorey: What did you want to share?
(01:38:28 PM) azlan: sir i did research on aestrik as you told me 
(01:38:39 PM) profcorey: Ok what did you find out?
(01:39:50 PM) azlan: I went through its architecture, stable versions, and how it integrates using AMI. I can also start mapping out how we’d connect it to our backend as part of the task you mentioned.
(01:40:17 PM) profcorey: Nice, what is AMI?
(01:41:09 PM) azlan: its Asterisk Manager Interface.
(01:41:48 PM) azlan: Its a TCP-based API that lets external programs monitor, control, and interact with Asterisk phone calls in real time.
(01:42:10 PM) profcorey: Great! that's super resesarch!
(01:42:29 PM) profcorey: A architectural diagram would be great
(01:42:34 PM) profcorey: An
(01:44:18 PM) azlan: yes sir so i will make it as my practice and will share as mail with you
(01:45:00 PM) profcorey: Great! Anything else?
